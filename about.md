# Risco came from our own needs.
## "Eating your own [dogfood"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)

"Eating your own dog food" is a slag expression in software world about using something you've built. 
It implies that someone built something out of their own need, and they are first hand users of the
solution. That expression summarizes the beginning of this project

Risco started while I was working at a FinTech company. After searching for the
available tools and services for lean risk management we could not find a
fit for our size and economic constraints.

We took ISO31000 as a starting ground, and we've developed a risk registry that
enables agile and decentralized processes of risk management.

We know how easy it is to rely on one person/team of risk managers, but the
truth is that we found benefits of bringing risk awareness closer to the people
who live the risk every day, like project managers and process owners.
