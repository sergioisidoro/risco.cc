# Eating out own [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)

This project started while working on a FinTech service. After searching for the
available alternatives we could not find a soulution that fitter our size and
economic constraints.

We've started out based on ISO31000, and we've developed from there, trying
to create agile processs of risk management, and focusing on decentralisation.

We know how easy it is to rely on one person/team of risk managers, but the
truth is that we found benefits of bringing risk awareness closer to the people
who live the risk every day, like project managers and process owners.
