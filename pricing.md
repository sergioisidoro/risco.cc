# We are developing Risco as open source!

We know the restrictions of the Industries Risco is aimed at - like the ones you might have contracting SaaS services in external jurisdictions and cloud platforms.

Due to this reason, and since our main objective is to facilitate risk management, we are developing this platform as open source, and with a flexible license - You will be able to deploy this system witout licensing costs on your own cloud environment.

# Pricing transparency
One of our objectives is to distribute risk management across organisations. Limiting number of users would work against that objective. We will not price per user, but per project to match and scale with our hosting costs. If you require aditional projects in Risco, contact us!
