# A family trip risk Assesment

Let's say that you're going on a roadtrip with your family. You're a very thorough
planner, even for the mundane things in life. So you decide to use Risco to
make an assesment of what could go wrong. You start by Identifying the assets you
want to protect, and their value to you.

### Assets
- The family
  - **Value**: Critical
- The car
  - **Value**: High
- The Luggage
  - **Value**: Low
- The insurance premium
  - **Value**: Low

These are very general assets, so you can evaluate them simply by their overall
value to you. We could analyse asset value based on different criteria also,
like Sentimental value, and monetary value. But for you this is enough.

### Threats & Scenarios
Now that we know what we want to protect, we need to understand what can go wrong.
Because things can go wrong in so many ways, we'll aggregate them into threats.
These threats can have an overall probability and damage to help us manage things,
but each scenario has also their own evaluation.

#### **Threat 1: A Flat tire**
**Damage**: Low  
**Probability**: Medium  
**Owner**: Car Owner (Dad)  
**Threatens:**  Car, Family  
**Scenarios**:

- A sharp object on the road punctures the tire
  - **Damage**: Low
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigations**:
    - Usage only of maintained roads
- Existing Tire defect leaks air
  - **Damage**: Low
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigations**:
    - Monthly tire pressure checks and visual inspection
- Improper tire maintenance leads to air leaks
  - **Damage**: Low
  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Mitigations**:
    - Monthly tire pressure checks and visual inspection


There can the case when some of the mitigations are owned by other person, other
than the threat / scenario owner. For example, the co-pilot making sure the
seatbelts are fastend at the start of the trip, and making regular interval
inspections  

#### **Threat 2: Car accident**
**Damage**: Very High  
**Probability**: Low  
**Owner**: Car Owner (Dad)  
**Threatens:**  Car, Family, Luggage  
**Scenarios**:
- Drunk driver rams the car
  - **Damage**: High
  - **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigations**:
    - Seat belts are fasten at the start of the trip, and make hourly checks
      - **Owner:** Co-Pilot (Daddy)
    - Passive safety mechanisms are mantained and checked every year
      - **Owner:** Car Owner (Dad)
