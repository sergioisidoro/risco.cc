# Risk management at small companies  

Risk management is usually associated with big corporations. Not anymore. Small
companies can now change the world with a few lines of code, and with that
power comes great responsability


Available tools to identity threats, manage mitigation policy lifecycles,
and assign risk owners are complex or too expensive, leaving small companies
with Excel sheets or outdated software.


By making this service we're aiming to facilitate the decentralisation of risk
management, bringing threat identification, evaluation and mitigation planning
closer to the process and risk owners.

# A simple process
