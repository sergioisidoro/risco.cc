# Risk management at small companies  

Risk management is usually associated with big corporations. Not anymore. Small
companies can now change the world with a few lines of code, and with that
power comes great responsability


Available tools to identify threats, manage mitigation policies' lifecycles,
and assign risk owners are either complex or too expensive. This leaves small
companies with Excel sheets or outdated software as their only option.


By making this service we're aiming to facilitate the decentralization of risk
management, bringing threat identification, evaluation and mitigation planning
closer to the process and risk owners. All of this accessible to small companies.

# A simple process
